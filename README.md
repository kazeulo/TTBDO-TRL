# Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Assessment & Recommendation Tool

The **Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Assessment & Recommendation Tool** enables innovators, researchers, and organizations to evaluate the maturity of a technology—from early concept to real-world deployment.

By combining structured readiness assessments with AI-powered analysis, the tool delivers **clear, actionable recommendations** to help teams move confidently toward commercialization and adoption.

## Key Features

### Structured TRL Assessment
Evaluate technology maturity across five critical readiness dimensions:

- **Technology Status** – Technical feasibility, validation, and development progress  
- **Market & Commercialization Status** – Market need, value proposition, and business readiness  
- **Intellectual Property Status** – IP ownership, protection, and freedom-to-operate considerations  
- **Industry Adoption Status** – Partner interest, pilot usage, and ecosystem alignment  
- **Regulatory & Compliance Status** – Standards, certifications, and regulatory readiness  

### Actionable Recommendations
- Generates **tailored insights** based on assessment results  
- Highlights **gaps, risks, and next steps** required to advance TRL maturity  

### AI-Powered Insights
- Integrates **Hugging Face models** to produce adaptive, human-like guidance  
- Supports consistent, explainable recommendation generation

## Purpose & Vision

This project is designed to **bridge the gap between innovation and market readiness**.

Many promising technologies fail not due to technical weakness, but due to unclear commercialization pathways. This tool provides clarity by helping users:

- Understand their current TRL position  
- Identify missing readiness components  
- Make informed decisions on development, validation, and deployment
