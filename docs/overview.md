# Overview

## About the Website

**TRLars** is an assessment and recommendation support tool designed to systematically evaluate the **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** of innovations within the **Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources (AANR)** sector.

The platform applies a structured readiness assessment framework and generates **evidence-based, indicative recommendations** to support the progression of technologies from research and development through adoption and practical utilization.

Technologies are evaluated using clearly defined criteria that cover:
- Technology development status  
- Intellectual property position  
- Technology transfer and commercialization readiness  

By standardizing evaluation and documentation across stages of technology maturation, TRLars supports **informed decision-making**, **strategic planning**, and **consistent reporting** for researchers, innovators, and technology transfer stakeholders.
